### SendBird Service
At the moment this is just to test the integration to SendBird's API

For now we will use the `testConnection()` function which will log a message to the console after a successful request to the API

You can navigate to `/messenger` and check the logged message

The only requirement here is the `appId` needed to create the instance. You can paste the ID directly to the variable for testing purposes but I'll be adding support for automatically loading environment variables
