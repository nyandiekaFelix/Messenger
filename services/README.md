### SendBird Service
Here we have the basic methods to power our chat

You can test the methods by navigating to `/messenger` and check the logged messages.

I'll also be adding proper automated tests using mocks once I start building the UI

Remember to paste the `appId` needed to create the instance. You can paste the ID directly to the variable for testing purposes but I'll be adding support for automatically loading environment variables
